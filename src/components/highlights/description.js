          The Eras Tour (stylized as Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour) is the
          upcoming sixth headlining concert tour by American singer-songwriter
          Taylor Swift. Having not toured for her studio albums Lover (2019),
          Folklore (2020), and Evermore (2020) due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
          Swift will embark on the Eras Tour in support of all of her albums,
          including her latest, Midnights (2022). It is her second all-stadium
          tour, after the 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour. The U.S. leg is set to
          commence on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, and end on August 9,
          2023, in Inglewood, California. Swift described the tour's concept as
          a "journey through all of my musical eras".
